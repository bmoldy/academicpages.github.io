I am currently a grad student at [Montana State University](https://math.montana.edu/).
#studying under [David Ayala](https://math.montana.edu/dayala/).
I am interested in algebraic topology and stratifications. 

I will try to post notes that I have compiled on various topics, as well as trying to keep some notes on the Topology and Geometry seminar here at Montana State.
